# Release Notes for v3.4.1

## Overview

This is a patch release that fixes a critical issue where the dist files were missing from the npm
package in version 3.4.0.

## What's Fixed

### Missing dist files in npm package (#65)

- **Issue**: The 3.4.0 release was missing `dist/index.js` and `dist/index.d.ts` files, causing
  TypeScript and module resolution issues
- **Cause**: The `dist/` directory was in `.gitignore` and npm was using it as the ignore file since
  no `.npmignore` existed
- **Solution**: Added `.npmignore` file to explicitly control what gets published to npm while
  keeping `dist/` out of git
